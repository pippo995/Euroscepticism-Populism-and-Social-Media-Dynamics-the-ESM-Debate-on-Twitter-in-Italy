Master thesis on "Populism and Social Media Dynamics: the European Stability Mechanism debate on Twitter" - Framework Python Anaconda

In the last ten years the development of social media and the diffusion of its use has been exponential. Social media, with their peculiar characteristics that drastically differentiate them from traditional media, have become a means of expression on a global, national, and local level. The possibility of active mass participation makes this new media suitable for political-social mobilization. One of the most striking cases is the ‘Arab spring’ and the relative use of Twitter for the mobilization and dissemination of information. But the potential of social media does not end in the possibilities of collective action from below: parties, political leaders and any actor using traditional media for communication, now have a new channel available that does not replace the traditional media by differentiating itself in the function of mediation, but rather by operating a paradigm revolution and eliminating the mediator himself, triggering a process of ‘disintermediation’. The case of the US presidential campaign in 2016 is striking: Trump's very wide use of social media, and his fight against traditional media, caused a big sensation into the world and is still the subject of numerous debates, not only academic but also of ethical and political nature. What are the consequences of the mass use of social media? Do the affordances of social media favour the spread of other phenomena such as the spread of fake new, or populism? 
So even when the movements of opinion on social networks do not result in real street actions, they deserve to be considered because: a) given the widespread diffusion of social media, they provide a valid measure of citizens' opinions b) social media are increasingly used as a medium to find political information and thus in turn social media influence citizens' opinions. In their work on hashtag #welcomerefugee Barisione et al. focused and conceptualized those cases in which citizens' voice conveyed through social media combines the traditional notion of public opinion and of social movement in "a new digitally based type of political force". The resulting theoretical concept is defined as Digital Movement of Opinion (DMO) and can have different characteristics depending on the case but is always referred to:

"Cases in which the general public actively uses social media platforms to react to a highly mediatized and emotionally charged event in a manner that creates the impression of a monolithic voice arising from social media".

The concept of digital movement of opinion therefore provides us with a useful framework for framing and studying debates developed on social media and focused on a single main topic, so in our case we applied it to the discussion that took place on the issue of ESM in Italy between end of November and beginning of December. Using this conceptual framework, we investigated quantitatively the salient features of the debate in question. However, before proceeding to the actual analysis, the debate itself was contextualized within the Italian-European socio-political framework. The contextualization also served to identify the salient aspects of the subsequent analysis, to design the questions and establish "what to look for" in the dataset. The result is a multifaceted framework within which various research themes intersect and overlap: the ESM, as a European treaty on financial matters, involves the Eurosceptic component of the public debate and the broader discourse on austerity and European responses to the recent financial and debt crises in 2008-2011. The salient passages of the development of the treaty and its reform have been reconstructed, as well as the mounting of a Eurosceptic sentiment within Europe (and Italy) in the last thirty years, with focus on the post-2008 period. The Italian national political context at the end of 2019 was analysed too. Regarding it, Italy stands out for the presence of populist parties with anomalous history and presence in parliament (over 50%), and the debate itself on the reform of the ESM has largely involved populist forces. Given this, it was decided to investigate two points: the link between populism and social media, a topic of growing academic relevance, and the link between populism and Euroscepticism, particularly in the Italian context. With regard to the first point, in addition to the analysis of the debate, an analysis of the users was made for the identification of social bots, with regard to the second point the content of the most salient tweets in the debate was analysed, using a qualitative approach, searching for key elements indicating the presence of populist or Eurosceptic rhetoric.
In conclusion, there are three key passages in this work: the socio-political contextualization of the debate on ESM in Italy, useful for identifying the subsequent themes and research questions; the quantitative analysis of the dataset obtained on Twitter, using the DMO framework; the qualitative analysis of the phenomenon in the context of populism and Euroscepticism established in the Italian political debate.
